# CTM_Assignment_2024-25

Hello CTM Applicants!

This repository contains four challenges, each of which has a hidden flag in it. Your aim, should you choose to accept it, is to find the flag in each of these challenges. You are also required to prepare a write-up for each challenge, outlining your approaches to the challenge. If you have any doubts feel free to contact me. 

Here are some resources to get you started on the challenges:

All The Best!
