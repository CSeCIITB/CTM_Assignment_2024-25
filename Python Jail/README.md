# Description

In your local machine create a file named "flag.txt" (without quotes). Then run the python file with `python3 jail.py`. Now, in the input area write a payload that prints out the contents of flag.txt

As the flag, submit your payload. We will test the payload on our own machines to verify its correctness.

### Note
You are not supposed to change the jail.py file we will test your payload with exactly the python file here.
